Job Search Database

What I intend to do is create an application I plan on putting on my AWS account.
I will even register a domain name to place this existing application.
This job search app will be based on the publicly created content.

As I job search, I run across companies that have different processes.  
As a software developer, there are certain things I expect from a company.
I want to know what their process is, and how long the process takes.   
This is a job search tool for us 'software developers' and not for companies and not for recruiters, but for us.

This is my new Winter 2023 and Spring 2024 project, and I intend to eat my own dog food.

First, in continuing my self-education, there are a couple of things I want to do:
1. This project will use a Spring Boot (3.x) backend, with Hibernate 6.x, and Spring Data JPA.
2. The database is a MySQL database, and eventually this will live in a Docker Container pushed to AWS ECS.
3. I usually use the Spring Tool Suite (STS) which is Eclipse co-branded with Spring (Pivotal), 
but I also wanted to learn how to use JetBrains IntelliJ IDE as well since a lot of companies have switched to this.
4. I intend to have traditional RESTful API's that push JSON and are Oauth2 (JWT) Secured.
5. I intend to have GraphQL API's as well since this should be easy with Spring Boot.
6. I intend to have RESTful API's that server HTML (hyper-media) for a HTMX front-end.
7. I intend to have a separate repository for a React front-end.
8. I intend to have a separate repository for an HTMX front-end.
9. I intend to use Docker to run both my Database and Application in Docker Containers.
10. I intend to use Kubernetes to bundle the Docker containers.
