Job Search Database

What I intend to do is create an application I plan on putting my AWS account.
I will even register a domain name to place this existing application.
This job search app will be based on the public created content.

AsI job search, I run across companies that have different processes.  As a software developer, there are certain things I expect from a company.
I want to know what their process is, and how long the process takes.   This is a job search tool for us 'software developers' and not for companies and not for recruiters, but for us.

This is my new Fall and Winter 2023 project, and I intend to eat my own dog food.
